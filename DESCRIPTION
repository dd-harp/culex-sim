Description: This package implements discretized stochastic and deterministic models
    of temperate mosquito lifecycle and infection dynamics, driven by temperature
    and photoperiod. The mathematical models are based on DDE models presented in 
    several papers, see the README for references. Models are implemented in C++
    for efficiency and the returned pointer object may be interacted with from R
    via an interface.
